A helper to list countries & states in English in **Laravel 5.1+**.

What's Changed in 2.0
-----------------

* **PHP 7+ required**
* Dropped Laravel 5.0 support
* Replaced [`phine/country`](https://github.com/kherge-abandoned/lib-country) with [`rinvex/country`](https://github.com/rinvex/country)
* Basic support for country name translations
* Exceptions when implicitly loading fails for country or state
* Removed HTTP helper to load states

Installation
------------

Require this package with composer:

```
composer require dougsisk/laravel-country-state
```

After updating composer, add the CountryStateServiceProvider to the providers array in config/app.php (not required for Laravel 5.5+ thanks to package auto-discovery)

```
DougSisk\CountryState\CountryStateServiceProvider::class,
```

Copy the package config to your local config with the publish command:

```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="DougSisk\CountryState\CountryStateServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

Configuration
-------------

By default, the helper will preload states for the US. You can change this via the `preloadCountryStates` config option:

```
'preloadCountryStates' => ['CA', 'MX', 'US']
```

If you don't want every country to be returned, you can define countries using the `limitCountries` config option:

```
'limitCountries' => ['CA', 'MX', 'US']
```

Usage
-----

You may now use the `CountryState` facade to access countries and states.

**Remember to import the namespace to access the facade in your files:**

```
use CountryState;
```

To get an array of countries:

```
$countries = CountryState::getCountries();
```

The array keys will be the countries' 2 letter ISO code and the values will be the countries' English name. You may also set the 3 letter ISO key as the argument to receive translations of the countries' names (limited support).


To get an array of a country's states, simply pass the country's 2 letter ISO code:

```
$states = CountryState::getStates('US');
```

The array keys will be the states' 2 letter ISO code and the values will be the states' English name.
